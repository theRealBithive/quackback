/**
 * Is this thrown value a limiter refusing, and what did it say to wait?
 *
 * Better-Auth raises `APIError('TOO_MANY_REQUESTS', …, { 'Retry-After': … })`
 * from inside its own middleware chain, so a limiter reached below this handler
 * surfaces as a throw rather than a return value. Matched structurally rather
 * than with `instanceof`: the error crosses a package boundary, and a class
 * identity check that silently stops matching would turn every throttle back
 * into a 500 with nothing failing.
 *
 * `headers` is whatever the thrower passed — a plain object here, a `Headers`
 * where the chain has merged one — so both are read.

/**
 * POST /api/auth/portal-signin
 *
 * Triggers a passwordless sign-in email containing both a magic link and a
 * 6-digit OTP. The frontend then shows the OTP input as primary; users can also
 * click the link in the email.
 *
 * ## Two properties this handler owns
 *
 * **It is metered, once.** Everything downstream that used to do the metering
 * sits behind a Better-Auth endpoint the signup policy can decide not to reach
 * — so without a limiter here, an unauthenticated caller could ask this
 * question about an unlimited number of addresses for free. The limiter runs
 * before the workspace is even read, so every address costs the same budget
 * whatever the answer turns out to be.
 *
 * "Once" is half the property and the easier half to lose: a downstream call
 * that re-enters the `hooks.before` chain spends the same bucket again, which
 * makes the answer that gets that far twice as expensive as the answer that
 * does not. `requestEmailSignin` mints through the endpoint that has no such
 * chain for exactly this reason.
 *
 * **It answers the same way whether or not an account exists.** One status, one
 * body, for an address that holds an account, an address somebody invited, and
 * an address the workspace has never heard of. `requestEmailSignin` carries the
 * whole decision and reports nothing back for this handler to branch on; the
 * refusal is delivered to the address itself. A 4xx for the refused case would
 * have been a free, unauthenticated account-existence oracle, and the
 * invitation exemption would have made it an oracle for "invited but not yet
 * joined" as well.
 *
 * The one exception is a domain that requires SSO, refused with a 403 by
 * `EmailSigninRefusedError`. That answer depends only on the domain, which the
 * sign-in form already routes to its provider for anyone who types it, so it is
 * the same for every address at the domain. Nothing that depends on an
 * account may ever be added to that error.
 *
 * Exported so it can be driven directly: a handler that can only be reached
 * through the router is a handler nobody can hold two requests up against.
