/**
 * TanStack Start global configuration entry.

 *
 * IMPORTANT: defining this file means our `requestMiddleware` list REPLACES the
 * CSRF middleware TanStack Start auto-installs when no start instance exists
 * (see start-server-core createStartHandler). So CSRF must be included here
 * explicitly, otherwise server-function mutations would silently lose
 * same-origin protection in production (the omission warning is dev-only).

 * Same-origin protection for server functions, matching the framework default.

 * alone, which is correct: the embeddable widget's cross-origin calls go to
