 * Everything the portal's sign-in dialog needs to know about this workspace.
 *
 * Built in one place because the portal builds it TWICE — once for the access
 * gate's overlay and once for the ordinary layout — and two copies of the same
 * projection drift silently: a field added to one is simply absent from the
 * other, and an absent field is a form that renders as though the workspace had
 * never answered.
 *
 * `found` is the one field the two callers still differ on, so it stays a
 * parameter: the gate can render before a settings row exists.
