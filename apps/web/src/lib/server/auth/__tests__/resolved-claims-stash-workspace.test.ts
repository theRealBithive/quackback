/**
 * The OIDC resolved-claims stash, across workspaces.
 *
 * Not on SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §4.1's list — found by the module-state scanner
 * this piece added, which is the point of having one.
 *
 * The stash carries freshly-validated IdP claims from the resolver to the
 * role-provisioning hook, keyed by `providerId + accountId`. Neither half is
 * unique across workspaces: `google` is `google` everywhere, and the account id
 * is the IdP's subject, the same string for the same human in every workspace
 * they belong to. Shared, one person signing into two workspaces at once has
 * the second sign-in drain claims resolved against the first — and those claims
 * are the input to role assignment, so the wrong workspace's `groups` decide
 * what the user can do. It is silent: the role mapping runs normally.
 *
 * Same class as `magicLinkStash`, which §4.1 heads its table with and calls
 * account-takeover adjacent.
