/**
 * Sends a passwordless sign-in email containing both a magic-link button
 * and a 6-digit code. Either path consumes a verification record on the
 * server, so the user picks whichever fits their context (desktop click,
 * cross-device code entry, link-eaten-by-Outlook fallback).
 *
 * ## Why this returns nothing, ever, whatever the answer
 *
 * A workspace that has closed sign-ups refuses to open an account for an
 * address no user row and no invitation covers. That refusal must not reach
 * the caller: this endpoint takes an arbitrary address from an unauthenticated
 * request, so an answer that varied with the address would tell anybody who
 * asked which addresses hold accounts here, and which have been invited and
 * not yet joined. Two visible behaviours, one bit of the workspace's private
 * state, no session required.
 *
 * So both worlds do the same amount of the same kind of work and end the same
 * way: read the workspace, decide, send exactly one email, return. The refused
 * address gets {@link sendSignupNotAllowedEmail} instead of a sign-in link —
 * the inbox is the only channel that reaches nobody but the person the answer
 * is about, and that message grants nothing, so mailing it to an address
 * nobody has proven they own gives nothing away.
 *
 * Metering belongs to the caller (`routes/api/auth/portal-signin.ts`), before
 * this is entered, so that both worlds cost an attacker the same budget. That
 * only holds if nothing in here spends it again — see the mint below.

  // already spent it once for this request — deliberately, before it knew the
  // answer, so that a refused address and an accepted one cost the same — and a
  // second spend here made the accepted world twice as expensive as the refused
  // one. That is the enumeration difference back again, read off how many
  // requests each address survives instead of off any one response, and it also
  // meant a real user's second attempt inside the window died on an exception
  // thrown from the middle of a request that had passed its own check.
  //
  // The path-less endpoint has no such chain to re-enter, creates the same
