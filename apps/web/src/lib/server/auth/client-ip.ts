/**
 * The client address Better Auth sees.
 *
 * Better Auth resolves the client IP on its own, from request headers, for its
 * per-path rate limiter and for the `ipAddress` it records on every new
 * session. Left to its defaults it reads `X-Forwarded-For`, which any client
 * can set on a request it sends directly: on a direct install that lets one
 * caller pick a fresh bucket per request, and a caller that sends no header
 * lands in a single bucket every other header-less caller shares, so a few
 * wrong passwords lock everybody out of sign-in.
 *
 * Instead the app resolves the address once, with `getClientIp` (socket peer
 * when TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS is 0, the trusted hop otherwise), and hands it to
 * Better Auth in a private header that Better Auth is configured to read and
 * nothing else. `withTrustedClientIp` drops whatever copy of that header the
 * client sent before writing the resolved one. `auth.handler` and the `auth.api`
 * proxy apply it to everything they pass on; code that calls `getAuth()`
 * directly and forwards request headers must wrap them itself, or the client
 * picks the address.
