/**
 * Claim normalisation applied to every OAuth/OIDC profile via the
 * genericOAuth + social `mapProfileToUser` hook.
 *
 * The hook's return value is spread OVER the resolved user info by
 * Better-Auth, so whatever this returns wins for the keys it sets. That is
 * what lets us tighten `email_verified` without patching the library.
 *
 * Kept pure and standalone (no DB, no config) so the rules are unit-testable
 * and so `createAuth()` holds no inline claim logic.
 *
 * The one rule it tightens is `email_verified`. OIDC Core types it as a
 * boolean, but SAML-to-OIDC bridges routinely stringify it, and the string
 * `"false"` is truthy — which is how an unverified address ended up marking the
 * local account verified. That value then renders a verified badge in admin,
 * ships as a boolean on the public API, and satisfies the local-verification
 * guard that gates trusted-provider linking. `isAffirmativeClaim` is shared
 * with identity resolution so the two cannot disagree about it.
