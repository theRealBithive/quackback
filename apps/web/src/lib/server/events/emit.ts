/**
 * `emit()` — write one durable event to the outbox, in the caller's transaction
 * (EVENTING-V2 §2.3 / WO-1).
 *
 * This is the ONLY sanctioned way to raise a domain event. It validates the
 * payload against the catalogue definition, INSERTs one `events` row on the
 * passed transaction (so the event commits atomically with the mutation), writes
 * an `audit_log` row in the same transaction when the definition opts in, and
 * inserts an `event-dispatch` job_queue row in that same transaction, plus a
 * row per reaction queue for a type that has reactions (`event-reactions.ts`).
 * The job_queue trigger NOTIFYs on commit. Leftover unpublished rows may still
 * carry `dispatch_owner = relay`; job-worker / scheduler start converts them.
