/**
 * Sink resolver registry (EVENTING-V2 §2.4 / WO-2) — replaces the monolithic
 * `getHookTargets()` if-ladder. Each sink kind registers a matcher + a resolver;
 * `resolveTargets` is a dumb loop over them. Sink-owned storage stays sink-owned
 * (the resolvers, added in WO-8, each query their own tables). Adding a new sink
 * category becomes a `registerResolver` call — no edit to a central function.
 *
 * The layer beneath — `HookTarget`, `HookHandler` / `registerHook` / `getHook`,
 * `hook_deliveries`, `safeFetch` — is reused verbatim.
