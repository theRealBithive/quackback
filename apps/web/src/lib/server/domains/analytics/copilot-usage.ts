/**
 * Copilot usage + outcome reporting (P2-D.2): questions asked, transforms run
 * (per kind), on-demand summaries generated, the propose-approve-execute
 * actions funnel, and the insert/feedback outcomes, over a date range — the
 * fifth independent bounded scan on the assistant admin page (plus a sixth,
 * see below), alongside SupportPerformanceCard, QuinnPerformanceCard,
 * QuinnToolsCard, and GuidanceRulesCard. Consolidating these into a rollup
 * table (the analytics_daily_stats pattern) is deliberately deferred until
 * admin-page latency actually hurts: every one of them is a window-bounded
 * scan riding an index, the same "low volume, no rollup" call
 * quinn-performance.ts and quinn-tools.ts already made.
 *
 * Data sources:
 *  - `ai_usage_log` rows with `pipelineStep: 'assistant'` and
 *    `metadata.surface: 'copilot'` are questions asked through the Copilot
 *    Q&A sidebar (assistant.runtime.ts's `runAssistantTurn`, called from
 *    routes/api/admin/assistant/copilot.ts). `metadata.principalId` (also
 *    added there) attributes a turn to the asking teammate for the
 *    per-teammate breakdown; older rows logged before that field existed
 *    simply carry no `principalId` key and are excluded from that breakdown
 *    (same graceful-absence handling guidance-stats.ts uses for
 *    `guidanceRuleIds`).
 *  - `ai_usage_log` rows with `pipelineStep: 'copilot_transform'` are
 *    tone/format rewrites (copilot-transform.ts's `runCopilotTransform`),
 *    with `metadata.transform` already carrying the transform kind.
 *  - `ai_usage_log` rows with `pipelineStep: 'copilot_summary'` are the
 *    retired composer "Summarize into note" action's on-demand calls —
 *    historical rows only. Its replacement (the Copilot panel's Summarize
 *    quick action) runs as a normal copilot turn, so it counts under the
 *    questions-asked bucket above; nothing writes this step anymore.
 *  - `assistant_events` rows are the outcome events the panel fires when a
 *    teammate actually USES an answer (recordCopilotEventFn,
 *    functions/copilot-events.ts): the `*_inserted` kinds (`answer_inserted`
 *    / `transform_inserted` / `summary_inserted` — derived here from
 *    COPILOT_EVENT_TYPES, never hand-listed) mark text landing in the
 *    composer, with `metadata.destination` ('reply' | 'note') saying WHERE it
 *    landed — the kind and the destination are orthogonal axes, split
 *    independently below (one insert vocabulary, one rate). `feedback` rows
 *    carry a `metadata.rating` of 'up'/'down' (an optional `metadata.reason`
 *    on a down-vote). These are fire-and-forget client events with no
 *    idempotency, so a double-click double-counts — the same trend-level
 *    precision the retry note below already accepts.
 *  - `assistant_pending_actions` rows are the act-on-approval funnel
 *    (pending-actions.service.ts): every proposal in range counts toward
 *    `actionsProposed`; `actionsApproved` counts a proposal as approved for
 *    the lifetime of that decision even after it later settles into
 *    `executed`/`failed` (only an `approved` row can reach either — see
 *    `settleApprovedAction`), since the report cares whether a human said
 *    yes, not whether the tool call that followed happened to succeed.
 *  - `ai_usage_log.metadata.citedSources` (assistant.runtime.ts's
 *    `deriveAttemptMetadata`) is the `{type, id}` list of sources that
 *    actually survived into a copilot turn's answer (hallucinated ids and
 *    duplicates already dropped there). `topCitedSources` unnests this array
 *    across every in-range copilot row, keeps only `type: 'article'`, and
 *    groups by id — the content-owner counterpart to `perTeammate`: not who
 *    asked, but which article is carrying the answers. Titles/urls are
 *    resolved live off `helpCenterArticles` rather than trusted from the
 *    logged metadata, so a rename is reflected immediately and a since-
 *    deleted article silently drops off the leaderboard instead of linking
 *    nowhere.
 *  - `assistant_events.metadata.citedSourceIds` (the copilot panel's
 *    `turnMeta`, set from the finalized turn's own `citations` at the moment
 *    an insert/feedback event fires) says which article ids the SPECIFIC
 *    answer being inserted had cited. Each top-cited source's `insertRate`
 *    filters this same table down to `*_inserted` events naming that id and
 *    divides by the source's own `questions` — a per-source echo of the
 *    card's overall `insertRate`, not a re-derivation of it. Rows logged
 *    before this field existed carry no `citedSourceIds` and so never count
 *    toward any source's rate (null, not zero — see `CopilotCitedSourceCount`).
 *
 * Multiple attempts of the SAME logical turn (a synthesis retry) each log
 * their own `ai_usage_log` row, so a turn that needed a retry is counted more
 * than once here — the same granularity guidance-stats.ts already accepts for
 * its "used" count, rather than a new precision this report invents.
 *
 * Indexes ridden: `ai_usage_log_step_idx` (pipelineStep) and
 * `ai_usage_log_created_idx` (createdAt) for every ai_usage_log query here
 * (the metadata->>'surface'/'transform'/'principalId' filters aren't
 * indexed and run as a Filter over whichever the planner picks — the same
 * shape guidance-stats.ts's own bounded scan already accepts); the new
 * `assistant_pending_actions_proposed_at_idx` (migration 0174) for the
 * actions-funnel scan, added because that table previously had no plain
 * `proposed_at` index at all; and `assistant_events_event_type_created_at_idx`
 * (migration 0189) for the sixth scan, the outcomes bucket — its WHERE names
 * the exact event types alongside the created_at range so the composite
 * index's leading column is usable (the metadata->>'rating'/'reason' feedback
 * splits are FILTER clauses over those rows, unindexed like the other
 * metadata filters here).
