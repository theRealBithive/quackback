/**
 * Conversation SLA sweeps (support platform §4.6) — the scan/claim twins of
 * sla.service.ts's lazy recorders, split out of that module to keep both under
 * the domain max-lines budget (the same split ticket-sla.service.ts /
 * ticket-sla.sweep.ts keep on the ticket axis). All three passes keep the
 * domain's invariants (see sla.service.ts's docs): SQL only narrows the scan,
 * the recording/claiming rule lives in JS, and every stamp write is the shared
 * guarded jsonb-merge (commitStamp) every other stamp writer uses, so a lazy
 * settle, a pause/resume, or a re-apply racing a sweep can never produce a
 * duplicate event or clobber a newer stamp.
 *
 * Wiring + claim ordering:
 *  - sweepOverdueSlaBreaches rides the per-minute sla-breach-sweep-queue tick
 *    (the REPORTING axis): it claims each breach-noted marker and appends the
 *    sla_events row, atomically in one transaction — see its own doc.
 *  - sweepApproachingSlaBreaches / sweepSlaBreachTriggers ride
 *    workflow-sweep.ts's 5-minute sweepSlaTimerTriggers (the workflow-TRIGGER
 *    axis): they scan candidates WITHOUT claiming, and the fire-once marker
 *    is claimed by the caller only AFTER the candidate's dispatch was
 *    successfully enqueued (claim-after-enqueue — see
 *    claimSlaTimerTriggerMarker's doc for why the order is enqueue-then-claim
 *    and not the reverse).

 * was never settled before close is a real, reportable fact — "nobody
 * responded before this was closed" — not a scan artifact to suppress.
 * Whether that fact is still actionable for a given workflow (e.g. "don't

 * workflow's OWN condition/branch on `conversation.status`, the same way any

// Timer-driven workflow triggers (support platform §4.6): sla.approaching_breach
// / sla.breached. Both are scanned from workflow-sweep.ts's 5-minute tick (NOT
// the per-minute sla-breach-sweep-queue above, which exists purely for
// sla_events reporting and is otherwise unrelated) and dispatch through the
// STANDARD multi-workflow fan-out (dispatchWorkflowTrigger, via
// dispatchSlaApproachingBreach/dispatchSlaBreached -> processEvent), unlike
// the conversation.customer_unresponsive / teammate_unresponsive pair in
// event-trigger.ts, which routes to one pre-selected workflow instead.
//
// Why the difference: that pair's fire-once dedupe is a BullMQ jobId keyed by
// (workflowId, conversationId, silence-start), so scanning "per live workflow,
// with that workflow's own threshold" costs nothing extra — each workflow
// naturally gets its own independent firing. SLA's fire-once dedupe is a
// CAS-guarded marker stamped on `sla_applied` (below), which — per the task
// spec — is scoped per (conversation, clock), not per workflow: there is only
// ONE `firstResponseWarningFiredAt` slot per SLA application, not one per
// live workflow. So when more than one live workflow subscribes to
// sla.approaching_breach with DIFFERENT `breachLeadMinutes`, there is no way
// to fire each independently off a single scalar marker — workflow-sweep.ts
// resolves this by scanning at the WIDEST (maximum) configured lead across
// every live workflow of that trigger type, claims the ONE marker at that
// moment, and dispatches to every live workflow together. A workflow
// configured with a NARROWER lead than the winning one is notified earlier
// than it asked for. This is a deliberate, documented v1 simplification
// (per-workflow independent SLA warning timing is deferred) rather than a
// bug: expanding the marker to a per-workflow map is the natural follow-up if
// multiple SLA-trigger workflows with different leads turns out to matter in
// practice.
