/**
 * Ticket-anchored SLA — the time-to-resolve (TTR) clock (support platform
 * §4.6). SLAs live on conversations AND tickets with DISJOINT targets: the
 * conversation stamp (sla.service.ts) carries FRT/NRT/TTC, while the ticket
 * stamp here carries TTR only — seconds from application to the ticket
 * reaching a 'closed'-category status. A ticket's stamp lives on
 * `tickets.sla_applied` and its timeline rides the same append-only
 * `sla_events` log as conversation clocks, with `ticket_id` set and
 * `conversation_id` NULL (a back-office ticket has no conversation, and even
 * a conversation-linked ticket's TTR is a fact about the TICKET, so the event
 * subject stays the ticket either way).
 *
 * Application is never ambient, mirroring the conversation side: the Apply-SLA
 * workflow action with `target: 'ticket'` calls applySlaToTicket directly, and
 * the create-ticket link flow (ticket-conversation-link.service.ts) hands off
 * the conversation's active policy when a customer ticket is linked to an
 * SLA'd conversation ("applied first time" semantics). TRACKER tickets are
 * excluded outright — a tracker umbrellas other tickets and has no resolution
 * clock of its own.
 *
 * The pause signal mirrors pauseOnSnooze with a different axis: a policy
 * opted into `pauseOnPending` stops the TTR clock while the ticket sits in a
 * 'pending'-CATEGORY status (waiting on the customer / a third party), and
 * resume shifts the still-unsettled deadline forward by the paused span — the
 * same math as the conversation's snooze pause, reused via the helpers
 * sla.service.ts exports. The status transitions arrive off the event bus
 * (sla.event-hooks.ts's ticket.status_changed case); deadlines that pass with
 * NO further event are caught by the sweep twins in ticket-sla.sweep.ts,
 * wired into the same per-minute (sla-breach-sweep-queue.ts) and 5-minute
 * (workflow-sweep.ts) ticks as the conversation sweeps.
 *
 * One settlement rule differs deliberately from the conversation's
 * time-to-close: the FIRST resolution settles TTR permanently. A reopen does
 * NOT re-arm the clock (the stamp's resolvedAt is never cleared), so a
 * reopened ticket can't breach again or re-report — reopenedCount on the
 * ticket row stays the quality signal for reopen churn — time to resolution
 * is measured to first close.

 * stamp, independently).
 *
 * Settling judges against dueAsOf (pause-adjusted): a ticket closed
 * straight out of 'pending' settles against the deadline shifted by the
 * elapsed pause up to `at`, exactly like the conversation's settle-mid-snooze.
 * When the sweep already noted the breach (resolutionBreachedAt is set), the
 * close only settles the clock — no second BREACH event — but a
 * `time_to_resolve_settled_after_breach` event IS logged (meta.overdueSecs
 * carries the lag from the pause-adjusted due date to the settle) so
 * time-after-miss reporting can measure how late it landed.
 *

 * recordResolution (see that doc comment): a concurrent pause/resume landing
 * between this function's read and its write loses the CAS, the stamp is
 * reloaded, and the settle is recomputed exactly once against the fresh
 * state. `preloaded` lets the event hook's direct pending -> closed path
 * thread resumeTicketSlaFromPending's return (the post-resume stamp it just
 * wrote) instead of paying for a second SELECT of the same row; pass `null`
 * (resume was a no-op) or omit it and the `??` fallback loads as usual.
 *
 * A close reaction can run after a later close's, so the clock settles at the
