/**
 * Extract client IP from request headers.
 *
 * Accepts a full `Request` or just `Headers` — server functions only
 * have `Headers` via `getRequestHeaders()`, so the Headers overload
 * lets them call this without forging a synthetic Request. The `source`
 * parameter is unused when trustedHops === 0 (see below) but is kept so
 * every call site has one signature regardless of mode.
 *
 * Two resolution modes, chosen by TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS:
 *
 * - hops === 0 (default, direct exposure): headers are entirely untrusted,
 *   since any client can set X-Forwarded-For/CF-Connecting-IP/X-Real-IP on
 *   a request they send us directly, and honoring them would let a single
 *   attacker spread requests across unlimited rate-limit buckets. Instead
 *   this resolves the actual TCP peer address via TanStack Start's
 *   getRequestIP(), which reads it from the platform connection rather
 *   than from any header. On the Bun preset this is backed by Bun's
 *   `server.requestIP()`, so distinct clients land in distinct buckets even
 *   with zero configured proxies.
 * - hops > 0 (behind N trusted reverse proxies): the client IP is the
 *   (hops)-th entry from the right of X-Forwarded-For, the standard
 *   trusted-hop model. Each trusted proxy appends the peer address it
 *   observed, so counting from the right lands on what the outermost
 *   trusted proxy actually saw regardless of how many untrusted entries a
 *   client prepends further left. Single-value headers like
 *   CF-Connecting-IP/X-Real-IP are intentionally not consulted: unlike
 *   X-Forwarded-For's position-based trust, there is no way to tell
 *   whether such a header was set by a trusted hop or relayed unmodified
 *   from the client, so honoring them would reopen the same spoofing gap.
 *
 * Known limitation: getRequestIP() depends on the platform exposing the
 * socket peer address. That is true for the built Nitro/Bun server this
 * project ships (`bun run start`), but not guaranteed for every dev/test
 * runtime (e.g. `bun run dev`'s Vite dev server). When unavailable, this
 * falls back to the shared 'unknown' bucket, matching pre-existing
 * fail-safe behavior instead of trusting a spoofable header.
