/**
 * Principal re-point registry: the single source of truth for what happens to
 * a principal's activity when one principal is merged into another.
 *
 * Merge direction is strictly anonymous-to-identified, and the attribute
 * conflict rule is USER WINS: the identified principal's data is never
 * overwritten; the anonymous side only fills gaps (see the contact_email
 * step). On unique-constraint collisions the anonymous row is dropped and the
 * identified principal's row survives.
 *
 * Every table with a principal reference must appear here as a step or in
 * REPOINT_EXEMPTIONS with a reason; the schema-walking completeness test
 * (principal-repoint-completeness.test.ts) enforces that, so a new
 * principal-referencing table cannot ship without a merge decision.
 *
 * REQUIREMENT for that audit to work: a soft principal reference (a column
 * with no FK) MUST be named `principal_id` or `*_principal_id`. A soft
 * reference under any other name and without a real FK to principal.id is
 * invisible to the completeness walk — the audit's one blind spot — and
 * would silently strand rows on merge.
 *
 * Callers: mergeAnonymousToIdentified (widget identify previousToken merge,
 * portal sign-in to an existing account) and absorbSignupIntoAnonymous (the
 * anonymous plugin's onLinkAccount signup absorb), both in
 * auth/merge-anonymous.ts. Identity teardown afterwards is the factory's
 * deleteAnonymousIdentity.
