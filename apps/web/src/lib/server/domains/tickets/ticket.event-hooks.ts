/**
 * Ticket side effects driven off the shared event bus (convergence Phase 1a —
 * scratchpad/convergence-design.md, second-opinion dealbreaker 3). Same
 * lazy-import pattern as sla.event-hooks.ts: the event reactions
 * (events/event-reactions.ts) route every `message.created` here, the hook
 * swallows its own errors, and the pure-DB recorders never re-enter the bus.
 *
 * Today exactly one reaction lives here: a VISITOR `message.created` on a
 * conversation paired with a CUSTOMER ticket reopens that ticket
 * (`autoReopenOnRequesterReply`). Without it a Messenger reply on the
 * conversation would leave the ticket stuck in "Waiting on customer" — the
 * exact incoherence convergence exists to kill (the portal/widget reply path
 * already reopens directly; this hook covers the conversation-native channels
 * and is idempotent against the direct call).
 *
 * LOOP SAFETY: the reopen emits `ticket.status_changed`, never
 * `message.created` (system stage notices — re-parented to the conversation or
 * not — are author-less inserts that dispatch nothing), so this hook can never
 * re-trigger itself; the recorders it calls are status-guarded no-ops when the
 * ticket is already open.
