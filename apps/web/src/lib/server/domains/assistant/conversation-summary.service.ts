/**
 * Conversation summary service (Quinn P2-A.4: past-conversation grounding).
 *
 * Generates a short AI summary of a conversation's customer-visible
 * transcript when it closes, so a later conversation with the SAME customer
 * can ground on it (see `conversation-summary-retrieval.ts`). Cloned from
 * `domains/summary/summary.service.ts`'s post-summary shape: same
 * config-gated no-op, same `chat({ stream: false })` structured-output
 * contract (TanStack AI validates against a zod schema instead of a
 * hand-rolled strip-fences/parse/validate pipeline).
 *
 * Two differences from the post summary:
 *   - The source text is the conversation transcript via `loadConversationThread`
 *     (assistant.thread.ts), which already excludes internal notes in SQL — a
 *     note can never leak into a summary a customer's own history retrieval
 *     might later surface.
 *   - The row also carries an embedding (via the shared `generateEmbedding`,
 *     not a new helper) so `conversation-summary-retrieval.ts` can rank by
 *     semantic similarity, and `visitorPrincipalId` denormalized from the
 *     conversation for that retrieval's mandatory customer-scoping predicate.
 *
 * `summarizeConversationOnClose` is best-effort end to end: every failure
 * (unconfigured AI, a malformed model response, a DB error) is caught and
 * logged here, so it never throws into its caller: the event reaction
 * (events/event-reactions.ts) that runs it.

Return strict JSON only:
{
  "summary": "string"

Rules for "summary" (2-4 sentences):
- Lead with what the customer needed or the problem they had, not "The customer asked about X."
- Name specifics: what feature, what workflow, what broke, what was decided or promised.
- Note how it was resolved, or that it was not.
- Write for a future AI agent that needs just enough context to avoid asking the customer to repeat themselves, not a full transcript replay.
- BAD: "The customer had a billing question."
- GOOD: "Customer was double-charged for their March invoice after a plan upgrade; refunded $40 and confirmed by the customer."

Example output:
{"summary": "Customer was double-charged for their March invoice after a plan upgrade; refunded $40 and confirmed by the customer."}`
