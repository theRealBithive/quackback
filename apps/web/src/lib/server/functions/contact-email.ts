/**
 * Setting and changing a signed-in person's email address.
 *
 * `user.email` is the account's identity: sign-in resolves by it, portal access
 * grants on it, dedup matches on it. So this is the only place it is written
 * for a signed-in person, and every write is preceded by proof of control.
 *
 * Two shapes, and the difference is not a preference:
 *
 *   no reachable address    a first-time SET. There is nothing at the current
 *                           address to protect and nobody to notify, because
 *                           the current address is a placeholder that cannot
 *                           receive mail. One code, to the new address.
 *
 *   a real address          a CHANGE. Two proofs: a code at the current address
 *                           first, so a stolen session cannot silently rebind
 *                           the account, then a code at the new one.
 *
 * Requiring the current-address code in both cases would lock out exactly the
 * people this exists for — someone whose provider releases no email has no
 * reachable current address by definition. Better Auth's `verifyCurrentEmail`
 * is a static boolean and cannot express that, which is why the step is
 * enforced here rather than in the plugin config.
