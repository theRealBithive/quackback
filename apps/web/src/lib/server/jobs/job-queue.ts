/**
 * The lease primitive (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §7.2).
 *
 * `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` releases the instant the claiming transaction
 * commits, so it cannot on its own hold a job through a multi-minute AI call or
 * an export build — the only way to do that with row locks is to keep a
 * transaction open for minutes, which pins vacuum and occupies a pooler slot for
 * the duration. `help-center-translate` already needs a 120s lock today.
 *
 * The shape here instead:
 *
 * ```
 *   claimJobs()      short transaction: pending -> running, stamp the lease   COMMIT
 *   <handler runs>   NO transaction open. Any duration.
 *   heartbeatJob()   extends locked_until, guarded by the fencing token
 *   completeJob()    short transaction: running -> succeeded
 * ```
 *
 * and a reaper reclaims leases whose owner died.
 *
 * ## The reaper is where this goes wrong, so read this before changing it
 *
 * `import` and `export` deliberately run with one attempt, because a retry
 * would double-import a customer's data. A reaper that returned every expired
 * lease to `pending` would silently convert *"this job must run at most once"*
 * into *"this job runs again whenever a process dies mid-work"* — the same
 * defect, with no error and no log, arriving only under the failure it was
 * supposed to survive.
 *
 * Two rules make at-most-once expressible, and they are the same rule stated at
 * two points so neither can be the only one:
 *
 * 1. **`attempts` is incremented by the CLAIM**, not by completion. A job with
 *    `maxAttempts = 1` that was claimed even once already reads `attempts = 1`,
 *    so it is spent whether or not anything reported back.
 * 2. **`attempts < max_attempts` gates both the claim and the reaper's requeue.**
 *    A spent job is not claimable and is not requeueable; an expired lease on
 *    one becomes terminal `failed` with a named reason.
 *
 * At-most-once means exactly that: a killed no-retry job may end up having run
 * zero times or once, never twice. "Always exactly once" is not available to
 * anybody — it would require the side effect and the bookkeeping to commit
 * together, and the side effect is usually not in this database.
 *
 * ## The fencing token
 *
 * Every write after the claim is guarded by `lease_token`. A process that
 * stalls past its lease, has the job reaped, then resumes and reports success
 * updates zero rows and is told its lease was lost. Without the token it would
 * overwrite whatever the job's new owner had done.
 *
 * ## Where the statements live
 *
 * The claim/heartbeat/complete/fail/reap statements moved to `lease.ts` so the
 * fleet migrator's claim loop is the same primitive rather than a second one
 * (SAAS-HOSTING-STACK.md §10.3: *"Fleet migration is its second consumer, not a
 * new subsystem"*). Nothing about the semantics moved with them — this file
 * still owns the queue's shape, the workspace assertion and the enqueue path, and
 * the kill-matrix proof still runs through here, which is what keeps `lease.ts`
 * honest.
 *
 * ## The workspace assertion
 *
 * The queue is per-workspace because the table lives in the workspace's own database —
 * there is no shared queue to route out of. That is a structural property, but
 * §3's whole point is that a wrong-workspace answer passes every other check in the
 * system without erroring, so structure alone is not evidence. Every claimed row
 * is checked against the ambient scope and a mismatch is refused loudly and made
 * terminal, never executed. The check lives inside `claimJobs` rather than in
 * each caller so there is no version of "forgot to assert".
