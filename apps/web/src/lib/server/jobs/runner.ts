/**
 * Running claimed work — the half of the queue that executes outside a
 * transaction.
 *
 * Everything in this module assumes an open workspace scope: `db` resolves to the
 * workspace's pool, and `job_queue` is that workspace's own table. `loops.ts` owns
 * opening the scope and the timers; this file owns what happens inside one.
 *
 * The load-bearing property is that **no transaction is open while a handler
 * runs**. The claim commits, the handler runs for as long as it takes, and the
 * lease is extended by heartbeat. That is what lets a job outlive a transaction
 * — `help-center-translate` needs 120 seconds today, and an export build or an
 * AI call can need far more.
 *
 * Configuration is read from `process.env` directly rather than through the zod
 * config, matching `process-role.ts`: these knobs must work in any context,
 * including a worker process that has not loaded the full application config.

 * `Worker` constructed inside a request's workspace scope inherits that scope for
 * every job it ever processes, because the scope is AsyncLocalStorage and the
 * constructor captured it. It was not a theoretical shape — the queue modules
 * that armed lazily on first enqueue armed inside whatever request reached them
 * first. No such module is left, but the *import* hazard below outlives them.
 *
 * This queue does not have that shape — `loops.ts` opens a fresh
 * `withWorkspaceScopeById(...)` around every pass, so a handler always runs inside
 * the scope of the job it is running, never one captured earlier. But the
 * *import* is a second, quieter version of the same risk: `def.handler()` is a
 * dynamic import, and a module executing top-level work would run it inside
 * whichever workspace's scope happened to trigger the first import.
 *
 * `primeJobHandlers()` closes that by importing every module once, at tier
 * start, **before any workspace scope is open**. The memo is then a pure function
 * lookup. A miss still resolves rather than failing — a direct `runJob` in a
 * test must work — but it says so, because a miss in a running tier means a

 * The tier's bounded worker pool — the answer to the hand-off `JOBS.md` §10

 *
 * **The problem it solves.** The first cohort drained serially: claim a batch,
 * run it to completion, then go round again and tick the schedule. That was
 * fine while every sweep was sub-second, and `JOBS.md` §10 said so explicitly.
 * It stops being fine the moment `help-center-translate` arrives, because its
 * lease is 120 seconds — and the slots that elapse while the loop is inside a
 * long job are *dropped, not delayed*: `latestSlotAtOrBefore` only ever returns
 * the slot bracketing now, so a two-minute job costs the per-minute
 * `snooze-sweep` and `sla-breach-sweep` two runs each, silently.
 *
 * **Why a pool rather than per-queue loops.** Fifteen loops per workspace would
 * multiply the poll traffic by fifteen against a per-workspace database, and the
 * database is the scarce thing here — §6's corollary is that this loop already
 * holds a connection per workspace open by design. One loop keeps one poll, one
 * listener and one claim query per pass, whatever the queue count.
 *
 * **Why per-queue caps rather than one pool size.** The reference gave each
 * queue its own `Worker` with its own `concurrency`, and one of those numbers
 * is load-bearing: `workflow-dispatch` is `concurrency: 1` because it is a
 * global FIFO, not because it is slow. A single undifferentiated pool would run
 * two dispatch jobs at once and reorder a reply and a close on one
 * conversation. So the cap is per queue, the claim asks for exactly the free
 * slots each queue has, and the FIFO queue can never have two in flight.

 *
 * ## What the state is for
 *
 * The first pass **adopts** the current slot without enqueueing it. That is not
 * an optimisation — it is the behaviour the repeatable jobs had, and its absence
 * was a divergence caught by running the old and new builds side by side.
 * Registering a repeatable job schedules its NEXT occurrence; it does not run
 * the occurrence that has already passed. Without the seed, a process booting at
 * 14:00 immediately runs the 03:00 daily sweep — once, because the dedupe key
 * makes a slot spendable once, but at entirely the wrong time of day.
 *
 * The residual difference is narrow and worth stating: the repeatable job's next
 * occurrence lives in Redis and therefore survives a restart, while this seed is
 * per process. A restart in the same minute as a slot skips that slot. A restart
