/**
 * Global request middleware — opens the per-request log context and emits
 * access logs.
 *
 * Runs first for every server request (SSR document, server routes, server
 * functions). It:
 *   - derives a stable request_id (inbound x-request-id / x-correlation-id,
 *     else a fresh UUID) and echoes it back on the response for correlation,
 *   - opens the AsyncLocalStorage log context so every `logger.*` call within
 *     the request automatically carries request_id + route,
 *   - logs request completion with status + duration, or failure on throw
 *     (a client disconnect at info, anything else at error).
 *
 * Downstream code enriches the context with workspace_key / user_id via
 * setLogContext() once auth resolves.
