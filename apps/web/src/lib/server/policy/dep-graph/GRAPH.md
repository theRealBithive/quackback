# Dependency graph (generated, do not edit by hand)

Regenerate with `bunx vitest run apps/web/src/lib/server/policy/dep-graph -u`.
A diff here means a dependency edge or cycle was added or removed. Review it as an architecture change, then commit the regenerated file.

Edges come from static analysis of import / export-from / string-literal dynamic-import specifiers. Type-only imports count. Self-edges are omitted.

## 1. Workspace packages

Nodes (6): apps/web, packages/db, packages/email, packages/ids, packages/logger, packages/widget

| From | To | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| apps/web | packages/db | declared + imported |
| apps/web | packages/email | declared + imported |
| apps/web | packages/ids | declared + imported |
| apps/web | packages/logger | declared + imported |
| packages/db | packages/ids | declared + imported |
| packages/email | packages/logger | declared + imported |

Hard rule (test-enforced, not just snapshotted): no package imports app code.

## 2. apps/web/src buckets

Top-level directories of src, with lib split one level deeper; root-level files form `(root)`. The components -> lib/server edge is the TanStack Start server-function pattern, recorded as reality.

Nodes (11): (root), components, integrations, lib/client, lib/server, lib/shared, locales, routes, styles, test, types
Edges (28):

- (root) -> components
- (root) -> lib/server
- components -> integrations
- components -> lib/client

- components -> lib/shared
- components -> routes

### Cycles

Strongly connected components with more than one domain. A new entry here is a new cycle and needs an explicit decision.

- assistant <-> channel-accounts <-> channels <-> conversation <-> conversation-attributes <-> inbox <-> tickets <-> workflows
- changelog <-> embeddings <-> merge-suggestions <-> posts <-> subscriptions
- settings <-> sla
