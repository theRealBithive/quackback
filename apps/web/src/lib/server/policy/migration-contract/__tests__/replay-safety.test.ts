/**
 * The replay-safety classifier.
 *
 * Run against the real 228 bundled migrations as well as synthetic fixtures,
 * because the question it answers is about *this* corpus: which of the
 * migrations a reconciler might replay against a database whose ledger is
 * behind its own schema would change data if it ran twice.
 *
 * The direction that matters is stated once here and then tested: a statement
 * mis-classified into `errors` costs nothing, because `migrate()` is
 * transactional and the run rolls back whole. A statement mis-classified *out
 * of* `mutates` is the real defect, so the `mutates` cases are the ones with
 * the most fixtures.
