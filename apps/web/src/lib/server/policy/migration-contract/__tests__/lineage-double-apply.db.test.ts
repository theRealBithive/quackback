/**
 * The whole migration lineage, applied twice, against a real Postgres.
 *
 * `replay-safety.ts` answers "would a second run of this migration change
 * anything?" by reading the SQL. Every answer it gives is a claim about a
 * database it has never seen, and the fleet migrator spends those claims: its
 * gap-heal truncates the ledger to before the earliest missing entry and replays
 * forward against a database that already carries the effects. A `safe` verdict
 * that is wrong does not fail here — it fails on a live workspace, mid-heal,
 * with the ledger rows already withdrawn.
 *
 * So this is where the claims get checked against Postgres instead of against a
 * regex. It applies the lineage once, then applies **every migration the
 * classifier calls `safe`** a second time to the same database, and asserts the
 * catalogue does not move.
 *
 * That is the whole of the lineage that claims anything. The other 197 files
 * claim only `errors` or `mutates`, which are refusals — a replay is never
 * attempted for them, so there is nothing to check. Re-running them and
 * asserting they fail would be asserting something the classifier deliberately
 * does not promise: `errors` is the conservative bucket, and a file in it is
 * *allowed* to succeed.
 *
 * ## Why this exists rather than a reviewer reading the SQL
 *
 * `0256_workspace_key_columns` is `safe` only because a human wrote
 * `-- @replay: guarded-by …` above a `DO` block the classifier cannot read
 * inside. An annotation is a claim someone can get wrong, and a claim nothing
 * checks is a loophole. This is the check — and it is not narrow to that one
 * file, which is the point: it validates every replay-safety claim in the
 * repository at once, including the 36 that nobody has ever re-run.
 *
 * ## What "changes nothing" is measured with
 *
 * The catalogue, never rows. On a live workspace the worker tier writes
 * `job_queue` and the kv tables continuously, so a row count cannot answer "did
 * anything change" — and an instrument that cannot answer the question here
 * could not answer it there either. Column shapes, index definitions and
 * constraint definitions are written by DDL and by nothing else.
 *
 * Index and constraint *definitions* are in the digest, not just their names,
 * because `0258` claims something specific about them: that renaming a column
 * carries its constraints and indexes with it, since Postgres stores them
 * against the attribute rather than the name. That claim is worth checking, and
 * a digest of names alone would not notice if it were false.
