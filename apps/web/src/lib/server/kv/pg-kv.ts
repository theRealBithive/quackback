/**
 * The Redis primitives the application half used, as single Postgres statements.
 *
 * GET/SET/DEL, SET NX EX, SADD + EXPIRE NX, INCR + EXPIRE NX. Nothing here is a
 * general key-value store; it is exactly the operations `redis.ts`,
 * `redis-rate-bucket.ts` and `signin-device-tracker.ts` issued, ported one for
 * one so the callers' semantics do not have to be re-reasoned.
 *
 * ## Three properties every statement below holds
 *
 * **One statement, therefore atomic.** Redis is single-threaded, so INCR and
 * SET NX are indivisible for free. A Postgres statement gets the same guarantee
 * from being a statement: `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` takes the row lock
 * and the CASE arms evaluate under it. Split any of these into a read followed
 * by a write and you have reintroduced the race the Redis version did not have.
 *
 * **One round trip.** The round trip, not the statement, is the whole cost of
 * moving these paths onto Postgres (measured in `KV.md`), and it is why none of
 * these is expressed as a transaction with two statements in it — except
 * `kvSetMemberClaimCounted`, which must lock in a prior statement so the
 * counted insert takes a snapshot that includes concurrent commits.
 *
 * **The workspace is in the key.** `currentWorkspaceNamespace()` is the same function
 * that built the `t:<workspaceKey>:` prefix on the Redis wire key, so the
 * discriminator is not merely equivalent — it is the same value, moved from a
 * string prefix into a key column. Under pooled tenancy the row is additionally
 * in the workspace's own database. See `0251_pg_kv_presence_realtime.sql`.
 *
 * ## Expiry
 *
 * Every read carries `expires_at > now()`. An expired row is invisible the
 * instant it expires, whether or not `sweep.ts` has run. The sweeper reclaims
 * space and never decides correctness.
