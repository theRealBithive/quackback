 * active session; the link callback verifies the IdP email matches the
 * session user's email, but — unlike implicit sign-in linking — does not
 * require the local `emailVerified` flag, because the session itself is
 * the ownership proof.
 *
 * Returns the IdP authorization URL to navigate to, or null when the
 * link couldn't be started (the caller should fall back to its
 * destination — the user is signed in either way).
