/**
 * Email sending module for Quackback
 *
 * Uses the Amazon SES v2 API or Nodemailer for SMTP, with React Email
 * components. No build step required - React components are rendered at
 * runtime.
 *
 * Priority: SES (if EMAIL_SES_ACCESS_KEY_ID + EMAIL_SES_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY set)
 * → SMTP (if EMAIL_SMTP_HOST set) → Console logging (dev mode).
 *
 * The order is deliberate rather than incidental. An install that has set
 * `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` has named the mail server it wants used and keeps it,
 * because a self-hoster with a mail server of their own has no SES credentials
 * to be overtaken by; only an install that has been given both halves of an SES
 * credential gets that path, which is a pair nobody sets by accident.
